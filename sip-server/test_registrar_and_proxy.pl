# This is a simple registrar + proxy which listens on 192.168.178.2
# for requests. Anybody can register with any address and if somebody
# invites somebody using over this proxy it will first check if the
# target address is locally registered and in this case forward the
# invitation to the registered party. Otherwise it will try to resolve
# the target using DNS and forward the request.
#
# Because it accepts any registration w/o passwords it's good for testing
# but don't use it in production
